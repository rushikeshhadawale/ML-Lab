#ML-Lab
Running First Machine Learning Program on Google Colab

Google Colab is a **free online platform by Google** that provides:  
- A Jupyter Notebook environment in your browser  
- Pre-installed ML libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)  
- Free CPU and GPU support for faster execution  

## Step 1: Open Google Colab

1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)  
2. Sign in with your **Google Account**  

## Step 2: Upload the Notebook

You have two options:  

## Option A: Open from GitHub
1. In Colab, click **File â†’ Open Notebook â†’ GitHub tab**  
2. Enter your repository link, e.g.:  
https://github.com/rushikeshhadawale/ML-Lab.git

yaml
Copy code
3. Select the file `first_ml_program.ipynb` â†’ Click **Open**  

##Option B: Upload from Local Machine
1. In Colab, click **File â†’ Upload Notebook**  
2. Upload your `.ipynb` file (downloaded from this repo).  

##Step 3: Check Dependencies

Most required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn) are already installed.  

If you need extra packages, run in a cell:
```python
!pip install package_name
Example:

python
Copy code
!pip install seaborn

Step 4: Run the Notebook
Click Runtime â†’ Run all to execute the entire notebook

Or run cells one by one with Shift + Enter

Outputs (numbers, tables, graphs) will appear below each cell.

Step 5: Save Your Work
To save changes to Google Drive â†’ File â†’ Save a copy in Drive

To download your notebook â†’ File â†’ Download â†’ Download .ipynb

Advantages of Colab
No installation required (Python & Jupyter already set up)

Free access to GPU/TPU (helpful for deep learning)

Easy sharing & collaboration (just like Google Docs)

Congratulations
You have successfully run your first ML program on Google Colab! ðŸš€
